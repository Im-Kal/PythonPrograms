# Aarush wants to create his application in python. He just knows the basics and wants to create something useful. Finally, he decided to create a calculator. He added some extra functionality which was useful for him. Taking inspiration from Aarush, Create your functioning calculator.
# Note :
# Add the basic functions in the calculator like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
# Put the entire program inside a loop so that users donâ€™t need to run the program again and again to calculate anything.
# Handle all the exceptions.

# Add basic calc functions. Put inside a loop. Fix user errors.
